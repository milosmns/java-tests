# Java Tests

Description
-----------

A simple repository with source code for my Java and JVM tests. Most of the tests are covered with explanations [on my blog](http://angrybyte.me/ "Angry Byte").

Importing
---------

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, go into project/module properties, then select the *src* folder and mark it as a source folder.
If you are using Eclipse or any other IDE, you are on your own.

Contributions
-------------

Feel free to add your own tests if you have some good ideas

# Java Tests

Description
-----------

A simple repository with source code for my Java and JVM tests. I mainly want to compare speed, CPU and memory consumption of execution for various tasks (like looping, creation and destruction of objects, etc).

Importing
---------

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, go into project/module properties, then select the *src* folder and mark it as **Source**. Then add another folder called *out* in the project root (not in the *src* folder), and mark that one as **Excluded**.
If you are using Eclipse or any other IDE, you are on your own. You can also compile directly from the console/terminal using **javac**.

Contributions
-------------

Feel free to add your own tests if you have any good ideas.
